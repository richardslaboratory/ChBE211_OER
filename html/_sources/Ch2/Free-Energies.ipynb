    "# Free Energy \n",
    "\n",
    "The **free energy is the energy available to do useful work**. You probably learned about free energy in General Chemistry in the context of chemical reactions. In that context, exothermic reactions are reactions where the free energy change from the initial to final state is negative and endothermic processes are those where the free energy change is positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "In thermodynamics, we consider how the free energy is affected not by *chemical* processes but instead by *physical* ones.\n"
