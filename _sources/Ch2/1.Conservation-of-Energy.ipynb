    "## First Law of Thermodynamics - Equivalence of work, heat, and energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement of the *conservation of energy* is the **1st Law of Thermodynamics**. Clausis put it this way in regards to a thermodynamic cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clausius Definition of the First Law\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In all cases in which work is produced by the agency of heat, a quantity of heat is consumed which is proportional to the work done; and conversely, by the expenditure of an equal quantity of work an equal quantity of heat is produced\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement has two critical elements to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fact that work is produced\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The fact that heat is consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "The interplay between work, $W$, and heat, $Q$, is a critical topic in thermodynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily concerned with how work and heat are used to change the state of fluids in this class. For example, the addition of heat to water to produce steam can be used to drive a turbine to produce work. In this example the heat has the effect of changing the energy of fluid water which can be used to transfer that thermal internal energy to mechanical energy during the steam's expansion through the turbine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More General description\n",
    "Another way to frame the statement of the first law of thermodynamics is that any change in energy, $\\Delta E$, of any system is given by the amount of heat, $Q$, added/removed and the amount of work, $W$ , done/by that system. \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $\\Delta E=Q + W $\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> Heat/Work added to a system is (+) and Heat/Work removed from a system is (-).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Energy \n",
    "There are three important forms of energy that contribute to $\\Delta E$ that can be exploited to transform thermal energy to work and visa versa for useful purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kinetic Energy** - This is the energy associated with mass moving in an inertial reference frame, $E_{KE}=0.5mv^2$ \n",
    "    - $v$ is the velocity of the object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Potential Energy** - This is the energy associated with an object because of its position relative to other objects. One example of potential energy is that which arises due to gravity, $E_{PE}=mgh$.   \n",
    "    - $g$ is the acceleration that the body experiences in a gravitation field\n",
    "    - $h$ is the distance separating the objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> There are many other types of potential energy that arise from other fields including magnetic, electric, and others.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Internal Energy** - This is the energy associated with the thermal energy contained within a material's molecular bonds and its contribution of energy is given as $E_{IE}=U$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The internal energy of a dilute monoatomic gas is a function of the kinetic energy of all its atoms, i.e. its temperature\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - We write this  where $U$ is the internal energy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see in this class that it is the role of unit operations to efficiently perform these conversions and the role of you as an engineer to design those unit operations to perform the conversion of heat to work as efficiently as possible.\n"

    "The full statement for the *conservation of energy* can be derived in a similar fashion as the mass balance expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we will set $\\theta=E$ or the energy of a system. From above, we know that the energy can be given as the sum of the kinetic, potential, and internal energy of the system, $E=E_{KE}+E_{PE}+U$. If we neglect the kinetic energy and potential energy contributions, or $E_{KE}+E_{PE}<<U$, then we can say that $\\theta \\approx U$ and we can then write the energy balance expression as:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Boundary work: \n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary work, $\\dot{W}_b$, is the work done due to changes in the system boundaries. In some cases, the system's volume is not constant (Ex. filling a balloon). In these cases, the expansion/contraction of the boundary leads to work being done by/on the system. In the differential form: $\\dot{W}_b=-P_{ext}\\dfrac{dV}{dt}$\n",
