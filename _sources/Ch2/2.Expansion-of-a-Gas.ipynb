    "When a high pressure gas is expanded, generally its temperature and pressure decreases. This expansion can be used for useful purposes. In this class, we will see three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Steady state, adiabatic expansion of a gas across a valve](#1.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Steady state, adiabatic expansion of a gas across a turbine](#1.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Transient, adiabatic expansion of a gas within a closed piston](#1.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last lecture, we derived the macroscopic mass and energy balance expressions given by (1) and (2) below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad(1)\\quad\\dfrac{dN}{dt}=\\sum_{k} \\big(\\dot{N})_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad(2)\\quad\\dfrac{dU}{dt}=\\sum_{k}\\big(\\dot{N}\\underline{H}\\big)_k+\\dot{Q}+ \\dot{W}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will simplify the balance expressions for the three scenarios above and see the results. Before we do, we first need to introduce new definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Steady state** - steady state means that there is no accumulation or depletion within the control volume. The implication is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dfrac{d}{dt}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> The opposite of a steady state system is a transient one, where $\\dfrac{d}{dt}\\ne 0$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adiabatic** - adiabatic processes are those that are well insulated such that no heat can enter/exit the system across the control volume. The implication is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{Q}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Closed** - closed systems are those that do not allow mass to flow across the system boundary. The implication of this statement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{M}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> TThe opposite of a closed system is an open system, where $\\dot{M}\\ne0$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with these assumptions, we can simplify the mass and energy balance expressions for the three cases listed above."
