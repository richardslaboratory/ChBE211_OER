    "Recall from calculus that if we have a function $\\theta(X,Y,Z)$ that is a function of multiple variables, we can write the total differential for $\\theta$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad d\\theta=\\bigg(\\dfrac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial X}\\bigg)_{Y,Z}dX+\\bigg(\\dfrac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial Y}\\bigg)_{X,Z}dY+\\bigg(\\dfrac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial Z}\\bigg)_{X,Y}dZ$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will combine this mathematical fact with the combined form of the 1st and 2nd laws to derive useful quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad d\\underline{U}=Td\\underline{S}-Pd\\underline{V}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closed System Expressions: \n",
    "\n",
    "For closed system problems, we general compute the change in internal energy $\\underline{U}$ in terms of other variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets see that in this combination of the first and second laws, there are differential expressions for $\\underline{V}$ and $\\underline{S}$ on the l.h.s. and $\\underline{U}$ on the r.h.s. If we use our the calculus description above to write $\\underline{U}(\\underline{S},\\underline{V})$, we can also write:\n",

    "We can go further, let's recall that the Helmholtz Free Energy is defined as: $A=U-TS$. Therefore, we can write:\n",

    "$\\quad d\\underline{A}=-Pd\\underline{V}-\\underline{S} dT $\n",

    "Now we see that in this new combination of the first and second laws, there are differential expressions for $\\underline{V}$ and $T$ on the r.h.s. and $\\underline{A}$ on the l.h.s.

    "Alright so that was a useful exercise, we collected a few new ways to inter-relate properties, but we didn't really accomplish the goal we set out for ourselves - to be able to compute thermal variables in terms of the volumetric variables.
