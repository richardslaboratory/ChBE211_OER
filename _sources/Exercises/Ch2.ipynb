    "Solar panels work by absorbing sunlight and converting it to electrical energy via the photovoltaic effect. According to NREL the average solar insolation in Evanston is 4 kWh/m2/day (~167 W/m2) on a sunny day. I am looking to purchase 10 m2 of solar panels to power my air conditioner which consumes 0.3 kW during sunny summer days. The specification sheet for the panels says that their efficiency is 14%. \n",

    "2. Given that the sun's corona has a temperature of 5800 $^o$C and the average temperature of Evanston in the summer is 35$^o$C, how many air conditioners could I theoretically power using a reversible Carnot Heat Engine? "
