    "The traditional role of a chemical engineer is to oversee the design, operation, and optimization of **unit operations** that are used to produce useful products. Unit Operations in physical plants are single peices of equipment that have a specific role in changing the state of matter and it is their combination that makes the conversion of one state of matter to another possible. Understanding the role of unit operations in process design is core to chemical engineering practice.\n",

    "Turbines work by using a high pressure gas to turn high speed rotors that convert mechanical energy to electricity and result in the reduction of pressure and temperature of the gas at the turbine outlet. In a turbine care must be taken to ensure that the working fluid and conditions of the expansion are such that the temperature of the gas does not drop below the critical temperature, risking condensation and damage of the high speed turbines.\n",

    "\n",
    "For ideal gases, *gas turbines*, the work is maximized when inlet pressure and temperature are large and the outlet pressure and temperature is small (i.e., the enthaply differences between inlet and outlet are maximized). These high temperatures and pressures are achieved by combining in-line compression with combustion to heat and pressurize the air prior to expansion across the turbine. The [Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/fecm/how-gas-turbine-power-plants-work) operates a funding program that has raised the operating temperature of metals within Turbines to exceed $800^{o} C$. Gas turbines are currently playing a critical role in the push to move away from coal-fired power plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "For steam, *steam turbines*, the goal of the designer is similar to that of *gas turbines* with the caveat that significant condensation of the steam must be avoided within the turbine (steam quality must exceed 90% for the turbine to operate safely). Therefore, high inlet temperatures and pressures are desired. These pressures are achieved by optimizing the combustion within boilers where high pressure water is fed into a combustion chamber and vaporized to form super-heated steam at high pressures. Typical temperatures achievable in modern boilers exceed $600^{o}C$ and pressures approach $50$ bar.\n",
