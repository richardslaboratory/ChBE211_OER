    "Gaseous mixtures are generally considered to be easier to quantitatively predict the state behavior as compared with liquid mixtures. This is because gases are generally more expanded than liquids. Therefore, their interactions are generally less frequent than in liquids and of less consequence to their material properties.\n",

    "## Ideal Gas Mixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal gas mixtures** are mixtures which obey the *ideal gas law* which for the purposes of this discussion, we write as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PV=NRT$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal gas mixture is a mixture where the gas molecules are so expanded that they neither interact with other species in the mixture nor themselves. We can compute the properties of an ideal gas mixture by assuming that each species in the mixture contributes to to the total pressure proportionally to the number of moles of that speices or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PV=RT\\sum_i^C N_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to obeying the ideal gas law, ideal gas mixtures have a number of important properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\bar{V}_i=\\underline{V}_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. $\\bar{U}_i=\\underline{U}_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. $\\bar{H}_i=\\underline{H}_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important property of ideal gas mixtures is their **Partial Pressure**, $P_i$ is given as the product of the total pressure and the mole fraction (this can be derived from eq (ref needed) above). Mathematically, we say that  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_i=y_iP=\\dfrac{N_iRT}{V}$$\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> To denote mole fraction of a gaseous species, it is tradition to use y instead of x.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is no difference in internal energy or density of an ideal gas containing $N$ moles of an ideal gas versus $N=\\sum_i N_i$ moles of mixture species, it is tempting to think that the formation of an ideal gas mixture has no energetic conequence. However, where ideal gas mixtures become distinguishable from ideal gases is their *Entropy*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The entropy change upon forming an ideal gas mixture is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta_{mix}\\underline{S}=-R\\sum_i^{C}y_i\\ln{y_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation, sometimes called the Stirling Approximation resembles the [multiplicity equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(statistical_mechanics) given by Boltzmann. This is not an accident. What this equation states is that ideal gas mixtures are mixtures where the species are thoroughly mixed such that all atoms in the mixture have an equal likelihood to be present within the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "For based on the above, the thermal properties of Ideal Gas Mixtures can be summarized:\n",

    "* $\\underline{U}^{IGM}(T,\\underline{x})=\\sum_i y_i\\underline{U}_i^{IG}(T)$\n",
