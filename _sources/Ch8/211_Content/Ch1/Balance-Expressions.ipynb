    "In prior classes, you have learned to think about material and energy flows into and out of physical plants. You perhaps even learned how to define a system by drawing a boundary around an area that you want to analyze and track the rate at which mass and energy flow into and out of the system. The utilization of material balance expressions is increadibly important to the topic of thermodynamics and we revisit it now. Before we do, we need two more definitions. \n",

    "A consequence of the flow of mass and energy into and out of a system is that the state of the system can change over time. How the state of the system changes in time is called the pathway and the path defines the physical, chemical, and thermal processes that the system is subjected to elicit a change of state. There are many different pathways that we will define in thermodynamics, but some important ones that we will use frequently are:\n",
