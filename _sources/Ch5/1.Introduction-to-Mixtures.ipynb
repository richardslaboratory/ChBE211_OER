    "# Introduction to Mixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixtures are fluids materials composed of more than one single component, $C$. Mixtures are incredibly important to chemical engineering as many crude products include crude oil are composed of more than one component. Useful products that are sold must be isolated from these complex mixtures. We perform these separations using unit operations similar to those that we have encountered already (ex., the flash drum) and therefore, in order to predict the behavior of these fluid mixtures and optimize their separation, we need to extend our existing thermodynamic frameworkk for single component fluids to mixtures of more than one component. \n",

    "## The Partial Molar Property\n",

    "\n",
    "where $N=\\sum_i^C N_i$ is the total number of moles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the properties of mixtures, we must introduce a new property, the **partial molar property**. The partial molar property is defined for a given $T$, $P$, and composition (denoted as $\\underline{x}$):\n",

    "## Property Changes Upon Mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes the **partial molar property** so important is that it is defined for each species to be a function of composition and that function is unique for each species in the mixture. This is an important observation. When we form mixtures of different substances the properties of the mixtures are changes from the properties of the individual species and from what we might have expected from the linear combination of the properties of the individual components combined. A simple example of this is that the miscibility of alcohols in water decreases with increasing molecular weight. Ethanol and water are miscible, but octanol and water are almost immiscible. Mixtures of alcohols and waters therefore do not obey our intuition derived from the pure component properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we say that there is a property change that occurs upon forming the mixture. We define that property change as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\underline{\\theta}\\big(T,P,\\underline{x})=\\sum_i x_i\\underline{\\theta_i}\\big(T,P\\big)+\\Delta_{mix} \\theta \\big(T,P,\\underline{x}\\big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\sum_i x_i\\underline{\\theta_i}\\big(T,P\\big)$ is the linear combination of the molar properties of of the individual species in the mixture at the specified Temperature and Pressure.\n",
    "\n",

    "- $\\Delta_{mix} \\theta \\big(T,P,\\underline{x}\\big)$ is a function that depends on the mixtures state and its composition.\n",

As for mixtures, we generally care only about effects of $T$, $P$, and $\\underline{x}$ on the partial molar property. \n",

    "An **ideal mixture** is one where the $\\bar{\\theta}_i=\\underline{\\theta}_i$ and $\\Delta\\theta=0$. Ideal mixtures occur when the species being mixed have similar properties. We will see that this is most often the case when the mixture is a low pressure vapor or when the mixture is formed from two species that have similar molecular volumes and interactions (ex., mixtures of hexane and octane approximate an ideal mixture). \n",

    "Conversely a **non-ideal mixture** is one where significant heat is evolved as a consequence of the mixing process or the density of mixture is significantly modified from what would be expected of an ideal mixture. Examples of highly non-ideal mixtures are solutions of aqueous sulfuric acid. At one atmosphere, the boiling point of sulfuric acid and water mixture can change from $100^{o}C$ for pure water to $w=50 wt\\%$ the boiling point is $130^{o}C$. At atmospheric pressures, sulfuric acid alone is a superheated vapor!\n",
