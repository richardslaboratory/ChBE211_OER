These are the lecture notes for ChBE 211 derived from Sandler: Introduction to Thermodynamics. These open education resources were made possible be a grant recieved by authors JJR and JD. Content preparation was aided by Jennifer Trost. 

This book is designed to facilitate a 10 week long lecture series that provides chemical engineering students with a strong foundation in thermodynamics of pure fluids and multicomponent mixtures. The chapters are organized to focus only on the information necessary to solve contemporary problems relevant to chemical engineering practice using thermodynamic principles and leverages jupyter notebooks with interactive plotting as an illustrative and problem solving tool.

Authors:
Jennifer Dunn, Professor of Chemical & Biological Engineering, Northwestern University
Jeffrey J Richards, Assistant Professor of Chemical & Biological Engineering, Northwestern University
Jenna Trost, Graduate Student in Chemical & Biological Engineering, Northwestern University
